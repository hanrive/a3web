        <h3>Drone Delivery Ethiopia</h3>
        <h4>Non-profit: Ethiopia Flying Labs</h4>
        <p>
          As the use of unmanned aerial vehicles becomes more affordable and
          accessible, organizations such as the Flying Labs are making strides
          in this sector across the world. In many areas of the world there is a
          struggle with the last mile problem especially in cases of essential
          healthcare delivery. Accessibility to healthcare is a huge concern
          according to the World Health Organization and we worked with Ethiopia
          Flying Labs to map out new routes to rural facilities. The new routes
          were created with input from local on the ground staff and allows for
          communities in rural sectors to gain access to vaccines and medical
          care that they would otherwise be denied.

        <h3>High Park Accessibility Toronto, Canada</h3>
        <h4>Government: Ministry of Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          Accessibility and walkability are important factors when it comes to
          park access. The Ministry of Transportation in Toronto has been trying
          to improve both of these aspects for the local population. High Park
          is one of the most well-known travel destinations in the City of
          Toronto and through local infrastructure a report was created to
          highlight the accessibility of access to this park. This report will
          be used as an exemplar as the Ministry of T ransportation examines
          park accessibility across the city.

        <h3>Right Whale and Shipping Routes</h3>
        <h4>Nonprofit: Ocean conservancy</h4>
        <p>
          The Right Whale is at risk of extinction. In studies it shows there
          are fewer than 350 left in the world. This rare whale species is at
          risk of vehicle strikes in the ocean. Ocean Conservancy is working
          hard to protect this species and reached out to collaborate with our
          organization. Through problem mapping and extensive academic research
          we used whale tracking and known shipping routes to create a report on
          alternative routes that would cause minimal shipping disruption.

          The World Meteorological Organization is a specialized agency within
          the United Nations, and they have an interest in extreme weather
          events. The damage and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost
          caused by extreme weather events continues to grow annually. We
          created a report examining hurricane patterns in the Southern
          Hemisphere and highlighted areas of concern where huge potential
          damage can be caused within the next 5-25 years.

        <h3>Rising of women's sports</h3>
        <h4>For-Profit: Nike</h4>
        <p>
          There has been a rise in the interest towards women's sports. The
          pinnacle of this in the last year was the FIFA 2023 Women's World Cup
          hosted in Australia and New Zealand. This past world cup has generated
          a record breaking $570 million in revenue alongside record-breaking
          ticket sales and viewership. Nike a sponsor for many of the National
          Teams that were present at the world cup wanted to capitalize on this
          moment. Their marketing team requested a geospatial report on the
          fastest rising women's sports in countries across the world. They used
          our report to help determine which grassroots and established teams
          they will pursue in the next cycle.

          Food deserts are considered to be a lack of access to supermarkets or
          local markets that sell reasonable substance. In Toronto as living
          costs increased over the last couple of years it has become apparent
          that food insecurity is on the rise with record people recording an
          inability to access and afford food. We aided the University of
          Toronto in mapping out the local food markets in the inner suburbs of
          Toronto. Through extensive web research and in person on the ground
          surveying, we determined the areas that were considered to be food
          deserts. This information was captured in a 40-page report on
          potential solutions that are aligned with the most recent Toronto Food
          Strategy report published in 2018.
